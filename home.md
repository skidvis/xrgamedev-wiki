# Introduction
This wiki is your XR Gamedev basics hub! 
Here we will detail the steps required for creating XR games in both Unity and Unreal engines (possibly other engines as well).

## What is XR?
The term "XR" represents both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).
VR removes you from your surrounding to put you in another world.
AR lets you bring another world into this one by overlaying graphics onto a cameras output.

## Who made this?
This site was created by Skid Vis to help people learn how to make XR games.
Skid Vis currently teaches gamedev on his youtube channel, [SharkJets](http://youtube.com/sharkjets).
