# Introduction
This wiki is your XR Gamedev basics hub! Here we will detail the steps required for creating XR games in both Unity and Unreal engines (possibly other engines as well).

## Who made this?
This site was created by Skid Vis to help people learn how to make VR/XR games.
Skid Vis currently teaches gamedev on his youtube channel, [SharkJets](http://youtube.com/sharkjets).
